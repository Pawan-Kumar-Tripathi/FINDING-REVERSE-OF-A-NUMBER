# FINDING-REVERSE-OF-A-NUMBER
In each iteration of the loop, the remainder when n is divided by 10 is calculated and the value of n is reduced by 10 times. Inside the loop, the reversed number is computed using: reverse = reverse * 10 + remainder; Let us see how the while loop works when n = 2345 .
